# This project aims to help you as a starter kit for any ReactJS project

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

You can find the most recent version Create React App guide [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).

It is divided in different branches main branches have simple names like master, with-api-client, with-apollo, with-firebase, with-electron. **Master** branch is the starting point for all the other branches and it is the simpliest react + redux recipe.

## Using only React and Redux

This is the basic starter point/kit, if you only consider using [react + redux](https://github.com/Robotois/create-react-app-redux)

## Using React Redux and Api Client

This has an Api client implementation that makes easy to add api calls to any REST service like [swapi](https://swapi.co/), the code for that is here [react + redux + api client](https://github.com/Robotois/create-react-app-redux/tree/feature/with-api-client)
